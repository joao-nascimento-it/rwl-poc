# RWL: Proof of Concept

## Process Modeling in Python using RWL

Model a system in UML and a program in Python that performs the following steps using RWL design:

1. Receive two positive integers LHS and RHS as input via REST API;
2. Print the numbers LHS and RHS on the screen;
3. Add LHS and RHS;
4. Print the sum on the screen;
5. Subtract 15 from the sum;
6. Print the subtraction on the screen;
7. Multiply by 4;
8. Print the multiplication on the screen;
9. Return the result.
